"Notes"
"The unemployment rate represents the percentage of unemployed individuals within the civilian non-institutional population ages 16 and older. Data are seasonally adjusted and based on place of residence. National data are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) LNS series, while state-level data, including Puerto Rico, are sourced from the LASST series via the BLS API."
""
"National data are rounded to the nearest thousand, and state-level figures may not sum to the national total because BLS independently develops the national employment series and does [not force state estimates to align](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.htm#:~:text=State%20estimation%20procedures%20are%20designed,errors%20than%20the%20national%20series.)."
""
"Area definitions align with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 15-01 (July 15, 2015) and are available on the [Bureau of Labor Statistics website](http://www.bls.gov/lau/lausmsa.htm)."
